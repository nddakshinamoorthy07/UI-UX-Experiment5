FitLife -UX Project Report & Prototype Overview
This document summarizes the UX work for the FitLife Health Tracking App and explains the prototype (website) included with this submission.
1. Problem Statements
Fitness enthusiasts need a way to easily track daily activities and progress because existing apps are either too complex or fragmented, which results in inconsistent usage and loss of motivation.
Health-conscious users need a way to receive personalized workout and diet insights because current apps lack tailored recommendations, which results in poor engagement and low goal completion rates.
2. Research Methods & Justification
Selected methods:
- User Interviews: to discover motivations, routines, and blocker behaviors. - Surveys: to validate patterns and measure prevalence. - Usability Testing: to iterate on flows and prototypes for clarity and efficiency.
Justification: Combining qualitative (interviews, usability testing) and quantitative (surveys) gives both depth and scale insights. Usability testing ensures the prototype is effective.
